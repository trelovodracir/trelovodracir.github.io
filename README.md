# My Home Page

I don't have much to say yet, but I intend to work on making it an incredible project, with a timeline, resume, API usage, blog of the activities I do and a mosaic of projects I'm developing. At the moment, I've only used it to test ligatures, as is possible to do in editors like VSCode, and for that, initially, I'm using the JetBrains Mono font via Google Fonts. 

I confess that it was a bit complicated to find the correct way to implement ligatures in HTML5 using CSS3, but it turned out really cool, but I still have a lot of work to do to implement all the things I'd like, since I'm just starting out (after years with other things) in the life of a developer.
